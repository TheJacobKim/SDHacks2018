## What it does
Smart Trash Bin lets you and your roommates have a civil way of handling trash disposal. 
First, you can input all the names of your roommates and set a schedule for everyone. Then when trash is full, it will send a reminder to the person who has to throw the trash out. If that person doesn't do that in a timely manner, the app will send more passive-aggressive texts.

## Demo
The app looks like this.
